# ds3000-final-project

To understand our passion for this Heart Disease Analysis and prediction project, please have a look at the Topic Proposals_group22.pdf.

The datasets we wrangled online from Kaggle and Data World websites are the data.csv, bak.csv, heart.csv, and Heart_Disease_Predictiont.csv, and we finally cleaned them and export them as the FP_new_dataset.csv.
 
During the course, Our team gradually found more questions about the database in practice. To solve the problem, we use Python for more refined processing and integration. These data cleansing steps can be found in the following files: FPdataset.ipynb, FPdataset renew.ipynb, and Update_of_FPdataset.ipynb. 

Our teamâ€™s final report could be found in DS Report group-22 file.
